= terraform-bundle Docker Image

== Description

This is a Docker image containing
link:https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/tools/terraform-bundle[terraform-bundle].
Its intended use is to help create bundles for use in other CI images or for populating local
workstation provider cache.

== Example

=== Multi-stage build

.Dockerfile
[source, Dockerfile]
----
FROM dwsr/terraform-bundle:0.11.13 AS bundler

# Add a bundle config to the image. See the docs for more information.
COPY bundle.hcl /bundle.hcl

# Build the bundle and put it in a predictable location. We unzip in this stage so that the bundle
# is not present in the next stage.
RUN terraform-bundle package /bundle.hcl && \
  mkdir -p /tf-providers && \
  mv terraform_0.11.13-bundle*.zip bundle.zip && \
  unzip bundle.zip -d /tf-providers

FROM hashicorp/terraform:0.11.13

# Tell Terraform where the providers are and disable fetching missing ones from the internet.
ENV TF_CLI_ARGS="-plugin-dir=/tf-providers -get-plugins=false"

RUN mkdir -p /tf-providers

# Bring the bundle over from the previous stage.
COPY --from=bundler /tf-providers/terraform-provider* /tf-providers/

== Motivation

`terraform-bundle` does not have binary releases provided for it (though they are easily
obtainable if you have Go installed) and Docker containers make an ideal way to consume the binary
as they are becoming ubiquitous and can be easily leveraged as part of a multi-stage container
build or as part of a Docker-powered CI system such as GitLab, Circle, or Drone.
